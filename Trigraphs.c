void main()
{
	printf ("Hello World??!\n");

Back in the 20th century, before Unicode was developed, many character sets had accented or different characters that took up the spaces of some of the punctuation characters that C needed. To allow people to still be able to program in C, the 1989 definition of the language defined nine three-character sequences that would be replaced with the characters that were difficult to access.
